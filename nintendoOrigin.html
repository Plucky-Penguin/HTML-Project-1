    <h2>How did Nintendo start it's company?</h2>
    <p>Nintendo began as a <strong>playing card company</strong>. These playing cards used <strong>seasons and
            months</strong> instead of
        <strong>numbers and suits</strong>. Nintendo eventually used their connections to move into and perfect the
        gaming industry.
        Nintendo was unriveled and dominated the gaming industry for quite awhile.
